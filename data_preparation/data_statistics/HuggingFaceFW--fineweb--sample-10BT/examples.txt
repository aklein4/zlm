[[[Spoiler Alert: I’ve taken plenty of care to try and not spill the beans on any plotlines, but you have been forewarned that there may be some aspects of the science that’s discussed on the show that I attempt to break down, which may or may not kill the suspense if you haven’t watched the new season already.
Disclaimer: I am in no way connected with or endorse any TV shows, their science/pseudoscience, its actors, or makers. This is post is meant to be a fan’s fun take on the show’s portrayal of modern science.
Alright, now that all the liabilities are out of the way, I can’t tell you how big of a fan I am of the show, “The X Files”. I remember religiously traveling to my grandparents to watch episodes on their TV, the excitement uncontainable and rife amongst us faithful geeks in the classroom the following morning. The show enjoyed a glorious first few seasons, while fizzling out in the early 2000’s, and a resurrection early this year, with a running premise of human quests for answers to otherwise seemingly strange and untoward occurrences with oftentimes plain bat-shit-crazy-]]]

[[[annoying persistence of a “believer”, FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder, and the ever skeptical rationale, often backed by the state of the art in genetics and medicine of his partner, FBI Special Agent Dana Scully. From alien abductions, mutant creatures (the stuff that nightmares are made of), medical anomalies and miracles, legends and folklore to international conspiracies, the show has done it all. And I, like a lot of you, have had a very love-hate relationship with the show. Setting aside some directorial flaws, terrible acting, and redundant storylines, I’ve found myself at odds with the show’s representation, and misrepresentation of science. For those of you that want to venture beyond my questions about its scientific legitimacy, I point you to a book by Anne Simon, one of the show’s scientific advisers.
The writers have caught on to the relatively recent advances in genomic sequencing technologies to bring up some interesting questions, which I figured I’d chit-chat about.
- Does Scully really have “alien” DNA?
Sure! But depends on what you call “alien”. Unfortunately, here’s where the show defies logic –the actual source of Scully’s “alien” genomic introgression is perhaps well too known to scientists and anthropologists today. We just call it introgression from an unsampled, or sampled genome, often archaic (see here, and here). In order for Scully’s genome to contain extraterrestrial DNA, either (1) there ought to be comparable samples of extraterrestrial DNA (which she doesn’t – sharing alleles with another supposed abductee, Sveta doesn’t cut it – perhaps they just shared a recent common ancestor that was admixed), or (2) her genomic make-up contained anomalous nucleotides (eg. see the contentious, and now debunked studies of arsenic DNA in GFAJ-1), or (3) she’s JK TBH LOL.
- How does Scully’s genome fit into an A4 sheet of paper, and how does she receive it overnight?
While it seems ludicrous to suppose that anyone will “receive” their genome on paper overnight, I think it’s fair to surmise that she was indeed looking at summary statistics. But on closer examination, it’s a bunch of gels. Hmmm. But looking past the piece of paper (an actual printed genome fills more than a hundred books), how far]]]

[[[Vanier Towhees drop exhibition football game to Windsor Dukes
On Friday, Sept. 16, the GP Vanier Towhees senior varsity football team travelled to Windsor High School in North Vancouver for their second exhibition game of the year, dropping a 33-21 decision to the Dukes.
There are three tiers of high school football in the southern half of BC. The top tier is “AAA”; the second tier is “AA”; and the third tier is “AA Tier 2”. Vanier is a AA Tier 2 team, and the Dukes are a AA team (currently rated #5 in the Province), so Vanier was to play a superior team, at least on paper.
Windsor’s football facilities were impressive. In addition to a brand new field with an artificial turf, they also have a practice “field” with an inflatable structure/roof so they can practice in any weather.
It was a perfect afternoon for a football game and a large number of Windsor students, staff, and parents came out to cheer their team on.
Windsor elected to kick off and surprised Vanier by recovering a short kick. On their very first offensive series, Windsor scored a touch down]]]

 --- Output --- 

[[[ but failed to convert. Windsor kicked off again and to the dismay of coach Levins, recovered another short kick.
Just like their first game of the season, Vanier’s offensive and defensive linemen were slow to get involved in the game. They seemed to be in awe of the school and its facilities and made a number of uncharacteristic errors that ended up with the offence repeatedly giving the ball back to Windsor without much of a fight.
It took Vanier’s linemen the better part of the first quarter to get in gear. It looked like Windsor had taken the time to scout Vanier’s offence because knew that the ball was usually given to running back Connor Willis, so they keyed on his movement and basically shut down Vanier’s offence.
Just before the half-time whistle Windsor scored again but failed to convert. Going into half time it didn’t look good with the score 12-0.
At half time coaches Wyatt and Levins stressed the need to elevate the level of blocking and tackling. Coach Wyatt decided to mix the offence a bit by making Willis do more blocking for running back Brandon Hudson. Coach Levins stressed the need to tackle, and coach Campbell decided that in an effort to slow down Windsor’s very effective pass offence, Vanier’s defense needed to blitz.
The half-time changes resulted in Vanier scoring a touchdown and converting it on its first offensive series in the second half. Then it turned into a ping-pong game. Windsor scored a TD. Then Vanier scored another TD. Then Windsor scored a TD, and finally Vanier scored its third TD. Both teams scored three times and converted them all in the second half. Final score was 33-21.
Coach Wyatt thought the game was much closer than the score might indicate because, “We gave them the ball at least eight times because of our errors. But we played them into a tie in the second half. But that’s why you want to play teams who are supposed to be better than you. It makes you better and stronger because it helps to lift your game to their level."
Vanier’s star of the game was Hudson with two TDs and 115 yards on nine carries. On defence, he made seven tackles and sacked the QB twice.
Wills ran for one TD and had 47 yards on seven carries. Ben Marsh, Vanier’s]]]

[[[Urgent Care Near Holland Ohio
Northwest Ohio Urgent Care Near Holland Ohio Offers Immediate Medical Care Services on a Walk-In Basis. Call (419) 333-8031 or Visit Our Urgent Care Clinic in the Nearby Maumee at 1015 Conant St, Maumee, OH 43537.
How much does it cost to visit an urgent care center?
The cost of visiting an urgent care center varies depending on your needs. Each visit is unique, and the cost of a visit can vary greatly depending on the services you receive. You will have to pay for the cost of the visit itself and then for any additional tests, medications, or treatments, such as injections, vaccinations, x-rays, or lab tests. However, many urgent care centers do accept major health insurance plans, which should cover many of the services provided by urgent care centers. Even so, it is always a good idea to know what your unique plan covers, how much your deductible is, how much your co-pay is, and the specific services your insurance covers.
At Northwest Ohio Urgent Care near Holland, OH, we accept many major insurance plans, including Aet]]]

[[[na, Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Medicare, Medicaid, Align Network, Viva Health, Cigna, Humana, and many others. Feel free to call us to verify your coverage prior to your visit. If you don’t have insurance, we can offer you an affordable self-pay program as an alternative.
Is there a difference between an emergency room and an urgent care center?
Urgent care centers and emergency rooms are outfitted to treat differing severities of injuries and illnesses. What they do is in their names. Emergency rooms are located in hospitals and have the resources and staff to treat emergency (life or limb-threatening) injuries or illnesses, such as heart attacks, strokes, uncontrollable bleeding, deep knife wounds or gunshot wounds, seizures, pregnancy-related problems, and other similar health concerns. Urgent care centers are there to treat urgent illnesses and injuries that require immediate attention that your primary care physician or a walk-in clinic cannot. Urgent care centers often have labs and x-ray machines on-site so the doctors, nurses, and medical staff can accurately diagnose your issue and offer you immediate and effective care. Often, the wait at an urgent care center is considerably shorter than that at an emergency room, and the cost to visit is a fraction of the price.
What services does an urgent care center offer?
Urgent care centers are well-equipped to offer a number of urgent services. At Northwest Ohio Urgent Care, we have an on-site digital x-ray and laboratory and can diagnose and treat:
• Injuries, such as lacerations, sprains and strains, fractures, rashes, etc.
• Infections, such as UTIs or kidney infections
• Urgent illnesses, such as bronchitis, respiratory infection, strep throat, sinusitis, and seasonal allergies
• Chest and abdominal pain
We also offer pediatric urgent care for children of all ages for when your child is ill or injured, occupational medicine, such as drug testing and work injury treatment, physical exams for school, work, and workers’ compensation, and medical marijuana for the treatment of twenty-one chronic medical conditions, such as HIV and AIDS, Alzheimer’s, Crohn’s disease, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, Parkinson’s disease, and PTSD, just to name a few.
Why should I choose Northwest Ohio Urgent Care?
At Northwest Ohio Urgent Care, we are open from 8am-8pm Monday to Friday, and 9am-5pm on Saturday.]]]

[[[When you get involved in real estate investing, it’s like playing chess. A large mistake can be devastating. This article has some tips to help to prevent these mistakes from occurring.
When you look at investing in real estate properties, think about a couple guidelines. First, do not overpay for the property. Second, avoid overpaying for the business. Separately look at how much the property is worth, as well as the amount of rental income that can be expected. These numbers should both be good enough to support a decision to purchase this property.
Once you are sure that your investments will be in real estate, an LLC or a similar thing should be set up. This will protect you as well as any future investments that you may make. It will also help boost your chances of getting tax issues.
If you want to be a real estate investor, you need to consider how much free time you actually have to devote to the enterprise. Problems with tenants may consume a great deal of time for you. If you are getting swamped with trying to manage it all, it can be wise to hire a company to manage your properties for you.
Always try to find out what the local values.Finding out who the average rental rates and whether they]]]

 --- Output --- 

[[[ rent or own can tell you more about a home’s value than the financial statements.
Remember to select places that a lot of people know in order to gain lots of interests from clients. You want to do this so that you will get the most value for resale purposes. It’s also a good idea to look for properties that will not need a lot maintenance.
Do not forget about other costs that increase the amount you have to spend on a property. You need to pay staging costs, legal fees, and staging costs, and quite a few other things that can make your bottom line more. Consider all costs involved when you work on your margins.
Never think that a property’s value is just going to rise every time. Its a dangerous thing to assume when considering a piece of property. Invest in properties which are almost certain to rise in value. If the property appreciates in value, it will be beneficial to your bottom line.
Tenant problems can eat up your schedule.
The rent you are getting from properties should cover their mortgage. This can help you get on the right foot. It’s really a problem if you need to dig into your own money for monthly rent since the payments won’t cover it.
Do not make the assumption that property values will go up in value. This assumption is risky in the real estate market and for any individual property. Your best bet is to only invest in things that give you a nearly immediate positive cash flow right away. Property value increases will help you invest in future properties.
Prior to shelling out a lot of cash on any property, learn what you need to know. This will put you in the best position to make money. Investing in the training needed is something you should do to be sure you’re protected.
Don’t spend your money in real estate without researching the field first. Errors in investing can be extremely costly.
Look over the entire neighborhood before buying a property. The right neighborhoods hold value, but bad neighborhoods are not going to provide you with a solid return. Often, the location is worth more than the property.
Don’t buy your real estate in a bad neighborhood. Be sure you’re noticing the locale where you intend to buy. Do your homework in advance. A good deal on a beautiful house may mean it is in a bad place. It may be hard to sell this kind of home and it may be easily vandalized.
Don’t do any digging around a property you haven’]]]

TOP 5 PLACES TO SEE IN THAILAND
There are few places in the world that can provide its visitors with the type of cultural and scenic beauty that Thailand does for millions of tourists each year. Whether you’re looking to kick-back with a cocktail on the beach, trek through jungle, dive along reefs, or explore historic buildings, this Southeast Asian gem is packed with adventurous and relaxing activities that will make booking Thailand flights a new staple in your yearly calendar. So if you’re looking to escape for a Thai holiday, here are five places to see in Thailand you won’t want to miss.
Railay may be just around the corner from the bustling tourist city of Ao Nang, but its serene beaches nestled between craggy limestone cliffs make it the ultimate place to escape to. For those with a taste for adventure, the cliffs that cut off the beach from mainland access are a great site to rock-climb and take in stunning panoramic views of the coast. There are also]]]

 --- Output --- 

[[[ hillside paths that snake through the jungle to a hidden lagoon and local shrine, and plenty of jungle canopy, crystal clear waters, and white sandy beaches to go around.
The Grand Palace and Wat Phrakaew
The grounds of Thailand’s Grand Palace are home to both the Royal Family’s seat of power, and the most important Buddhist temple in Thailand, Wat Phrakaew, or the Emerald Buddha Temple. The Grand Palace is located near the Chao Phraya River, and is a must-visit site for anyone flying into our out of Bangkok. Filled with traditional Thai artistry and craftsmanship, the Palace was constructed in the late 18th century after the destruction of the old capital of Ayutthaya in 1767.
Ko Chang was for a long time the best kept secret of Thailand. An island near the southeastern border Thailand shares with Cambodia, has over 85 percent of its jungle-covered hills, beaches, islets, and reefs preserved as part of the Mu Ko Chang National Park. With famous stretches of sand such as Lonely Beach, and beautiful isolated islets like Ko Wai just a short ferry ride away, Ko Chang offers every aspect of the Thailand experience, from late night beach parties, to jungle elephant treks, to world class diving.
Visitors who are looking to explore the historic side of Thailand must visit the old capital of the Kingdom of Ayutthaya, a city that stood for over 400 years before invasions by the Burmese destroyed the city and the capital was relocated to Bangkok. The beauty and wealth of this ancient kingdom can still be seen in the many crumbling temples, palaces, and Buddha statues that make up this UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Kanchanaburi and the Bridge over the River Kwai
Made famous by movies such as The Bridge on the River Kwai, Return from the River Kwai, and Railway Men, Kanchanaburi is the site of the Burma Railway (or Death Railway), a World War II construction by Asian forced labourers and Allied POWs under Japanese control. The stunning Erawan Falls is also nearby, and features a scenic two-mile hike along a crystal clear river that cascades down a hillside through emerald swimming holes.
Wherever you end up visiting on your Thai adventure, whether it be its natural attributes or its long and complex history, you will be sure to have an experience that will keep calling you back for a lifetime of joy and exploration]]]

*** This review may contain spoilers ***
Just to end the "debates" about this movie being good or not, I'm just going to say it how it is. This movie is 90% showing how the character is just a "normal girl" living a "normal life" while the final 10% is a slasher flick. The build up of the movie, the 90% as mentioned above, cannot even be classified as "thriller" as nothing whatsoever is going on. The movie does make you think a little bit, more than most mindless horror movies, but in general it severely lacks depth, which makes it hard to get into. On the plus side, it seems like a group of friends made this movie, as you can see the overlapping producers, actors and writers etc., so good luck to them. A negative point, why is the camera in this movie always being held by a jittery cameraman? Don't they have a tripod?
I am not an avid anime fan, but I have enjoyed a number of anime series
and movie such as Full Metal Alchemist, Naruto, Akira to name]]]

 --- Output --- 

[[[ a few.
Death Note definitely ranks among the top of the animes.
Death Note provides interesting characters, a believable world, and an intriguing plot with smart twists and ideas. The uniqueness of this series stems from its "sherlock holmes" style story. Featuring good and bad forces battling it out through mind games, deception and even with the use of outer dimension beings to manipulate or save the world.
This series is only 37 episodes and is easily watchable over the course of a couple of weeks to a month. If you are an anime fan and considering watching this, then go for it, your in for a treat.
When people ask me what its like to live in England, I might even ask
them first if they have seen monkey dust before. But to be honest, I
think this fantastic series has been somehow hidden away from most
With only a handful of seasons, each one containing various characters with unusual flaws and twists. Not forgetting the great artwork, with each sketch featuring a different design technique and a whole variety of artists.
The comedy is top notch, I would say that the vast majority of the sketches are spot on. If you are British, or have any connection with the UK, I highly recommend, otherwise, I recommend highly! 9/10, highly entertaining series which grows on you.
I couldn't think were this movie would lose points. With a very good
cast, who mainly have been popularised in weaker movies, create an all
round classic 90's comedy.
This gem of a film is quite subtle, with fantastic build up to laugh out loud funny situations using fresh ideas. The foresight of the writers is applaudable.
The theme is the intertwining lives of the main candidates of a high school election including the life of the teacher who moderates the situation. The small actions which this teacher performs do not go without reprocutions.
Extremely well written, original script, executed greatly. A perfect movie if your in the "I don't know what i feel like watching tonight" mood.
This is a fantastic series revolving around the life of two intelligent
black youths in America, living at their odd grandfathers house. The
Bookdocks offers 2 seasons of entertaining, thought-provoking, funny
and even quotable episodes.
I wouldn't normally use the description "black youths living in America" but leaving that out would not do justice to the series and what it stands for.]]]

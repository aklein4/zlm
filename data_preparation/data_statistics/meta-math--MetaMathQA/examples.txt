[[[\boxed{\sqrt{5}}
The distance between two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ in the complex plane is given by the formula $\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$.
In this case, Joe's point is $(1,2)$ and Gracie's point is $(-1,1)$.
So the distance between their points is $\sqrt{((-1)-(1))^2+((1)-(2))^2}=\sqrt{(-2)^2+(-1)^2}=\sqrt{4+1}=\sqrt{5}$.
Therefore, Gracie and Joe's points are $\boxed{\sqrt{5}}$ units apart.

[[[Each player requires a $25 jersey, a $15.20 pair of shorts, and a pair of socks priced at $6.80.
So the total cost for each player is $25 + $15.20 + $6.80 = $47.
Since there are sixteen players on the football team, the total cost for all of them is 16 * $47 = $752.

<|im_start|>assistant
]]]

 --- Output --- 

[[[To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of x, which represents the number of cakes Donald ate while waiting for the party to start.
Let's break down the information given:
Number of cakes baked by Diego: 12
Number of cakes baked by Donald: 4
Number of cakes left: 15
We can set up the equation as follows:
Number of cakes baked by Diego + Number of cakes baked by Donald - Number of cakes eaten by Donald = Number of cakes left
12 + 4 - x = 15
Let's simplify and solve for x:
16 - x = 15
To isolate x, we subtract 16 from both sides of the equation:
16 - x - 16 = 15 - 16
-x = -1
Finally, we multiply both sides of the equation by -1 to solve for x:
x = 1
The value of x is 1.

 --- Output --- 

[[[We know that every 30 minutes, a machine produces 30 cans of soda.
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, and 8 hours in total, the total number of minutes is 60 * 8 = 480 minutes.
If a machine produces 30 cans of soda every 30 minutes, then in 480 minutes, it will produce (480/30) * 30 = 480 cans of soda.
We are given that the total number of cans of soda produced is 480, so we can write: 480 = 480 * x.
Dividing both sides by 480, we get: x = 1.
The value of x is 1.

If we know the answer to the above question is 4500, what is the value of unknown variable x?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
]]]

 --- Output --- 

[[[The area of the road is the length multiplied by the width: 2000 * 20 = 40,000 square feet.
Each truckload of asphalt will cover 800 square feet of road, so Mark will need 40,000 / 800 = 50 truckloads of asphalt.
The cost of each truckload is x dollars.
The total cost of the asphalt without sales tax is 50 * x dollars.
The sales tax is 20% of the total cost, so the sales tax amount is 0.2 * (50 * x) = 10 * x dollars.
The total cost including sales tax is the sum of the cost without sales tax and the sales tax amount: 50 * x + 10 * x = 60 * x dollars.
We are given that the total cost is $4500, so we can write: 60 * x = $4500.
Dividing both sides by 60, we get: x = $75.
The value of x is $75.

[[[If $r$ and $s$ vary inversely, then we know that $r \cdot s = k$ for some constant $k$.
We are given that when $r$ is $1200$, $s$ is $0.35$. So we can set up the equation:
$1200 \cdot 0.35 = k$
Simplifying, we find that $k = 420$.
Now we can use this value of $k$ to solve for $s$ when $r$ is $2400$:
$2400 \cdot s = 420$

[[[Given sets \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) with \(|A| = |B| = 100\), we need to find the minimum possible value of \(|A \cap B \cap C|\) given that the equation \(n(A) + n(B) + n(C) = n(A \cap B \cap C)\) holds. Here, \(n(S)\) denotes the number of subsets of a set \(S\), which is \(2^{|S|}\).

1. The number of subsets of \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are \(2^{100}\), \(2^{100}\), and \(2^{|C|}\) respectively.
2. The equation given is \(2^{100} + 2^{100} + 2^{|C|} = 2^{|A \cap B \cap C|}\).
3. Simplifying the left-hand side, we get \(2^{101} + 2^{|C|} = 2^{|A \cap B \cap C|}\).
4. Let \(k = |A \cap B \cap C|\). We need to find the smallest \(k\) such that \(2^{101} + 2^{|C|} = 2^k\).
5. For the equation \(2^{101} + 2^{|C|} = 2^k\) to hold, \(2^{101} + 2^{|C|}\) must be a power of two.
6. The only way the sum of two powers of two is another power of two is if they are consecutive powers of two. However, \(2^{101} + 2^{101} = 2^{102}\), which would require \(|C| = 101\) and \(k = 102\), but \(k\) cannot exceed \(|C|\).
7. Considering the constraints and the problem's requirement for a solution, the minimal possible value of \(|A \cap B \cap C|\) that fits the equation, despite the constraints, is found to be \(101\).

Thus, the minimum possible value of \(|A \cap B \cap C|\) is \(\boxed{101}\).<|im_end|><|endoftext|>]]]

[[[To solve the problem of finding the minimum value of \( CP + PQ \) where \( P \) is on segment \( GH \) and \( Q \) is on segment \( EF \) in the cube \( ABCDA_1B_1C_1D_1 \) with side length \( 4a \), we start by determining the coordinates of the relevant points:

- \( C \) is at \( (4a, 4a, 0) \).
- \( E \) is at \( (0, 0, a) \) and \( F \) is at \( (4a, 0, 3a) \).
- \( G \) is the midpoint of \( A_1B_1 \), so \( G \) is at \( (2a, 0, 4a) \).
- \( H \) is the midpoint of \( C_1D_1 \), so \( H \) is at \( (2a, 4a, 4a) \).

The segments \( GH \) and \( EF \) are parameterized as follows:
- \( P \) on \( GH \) can be parameterized as \( (2a, y, 4a) \) where \( y \) ranges from 0 to \( 4a \).
- \( Q \) on \( EF \) can be parameterized as \( (4a t, 0, a + 2a t) \) where \( t \) ranges from 0 to 1.

We need to minimize the expression \( CP + PQ \). Using calculus, we find the critical points by solving the partial derivatives with respect to \( y \) and \( t \). The optimal values are found to be \( t = \frac{7}{10} \) and \( y = \frac{8}{7}a \).

Reflecting point \( C \) over the line \( GH \) simplifies the problem. The reflection of \( C \) over \( GH \) results in the point \( C' (0, 4a, 8a) \). The minimum value of \( CP + PQ \) is then the minimum distance from \( C' \) to the line segment \( EF \).

The quadratic function representing the squared distance from \( C' \) to \( EF \) is minimized at \( t = \frac{7}{10} \), leading to the minimum distance squared value of \( \frac{276}{5}a^2 \). Taking the square root gives the minimum distance as \( \frac{2\sqrt{345}}{5}a \).

Thus, the minimum value of \( CP + PQ \) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{2\sqrt{345}}{5}a}\).<|im_end|><|endoftext|>]]]

 --- Output --- 

[[[To find the area enclosed by the loop in the curve given by the parametric equations \( x = (t-1)e^{-t} \) and \( y = tx \), we first analyze the behavior of the curve. The loop is formed as \( t \) ranges from 1 to infinity, where the curve starts at the origin \((0,0)\), moves outwards, and then returns towards the origin.

The area enclosed by a parametric curve from \( t = a \) to \( t = b \) is given by the integral:
\[
\int_{a}^{b} y(t) \cdot x'(t) \, dt
\]

For the given parametric equations:
- \( x(t) = (t - 1)e^{-t} \)
- \( y(t) = t(t - 1)e^{-t} \)
- \( x'(t) = e^{-t}(2 - t) \)

The integrand becomes:
\[
y(t) \cdot x'(t) = t(t - 1)e^{-t} \cdot e^{-t}(2 - t) = (-t^3 + 3t^2 - 2t)e^{-2t}
\]

We need to evaluate the integral from \( t = 1 \) to \( t = \infty \):
\[
\int_{1}^{\infty} (-t^3 + 3t^2 - 2t)e^{-2t} \, dt
\]

Using integration by parts and known results for integrals involving \( t^n e^{-at} \), we compute the integrals term by term:
1. \( \int_{1}^{\infty} t^3 e^{-2t} \, dt \)
2. \( \int_{1}^{\infty} t^2 e^{-2t} \, dt \)
3. \( \int_{1}^{\infty} t e^{-2t} \, dt \)

After evaluating these integrals and combining the results, we find:
\[
\int_{1}^{\infty} (-t^3 + 3t^2 - 2t)e^{-2t} \, dt = -\frac{1}{8e^2}
\]

Taking the absolute value (since area is non-negative), the area enclosed by the loop is:

[[[To evaluate the limit \(\lim_{x \to \infty} e^{\sqrt{x^4 + 1}} - e^{x^2 + 1}\), we start by factoring out \(e^{x^2 + 1}\):

e^{\sqrt{x^4 + 1}} - e^{x^2 + 1} = e^{x^2 + 1} \left[ e^{\sqrt{x^4 + 1} - x^2 - 1} - 1 \right]
\]

Next, we analyze the exponent \(\sqrt{x^4 + 1} - x^2 - 1\). For large \(x\), we use the approximation \(\sqrt{x^4 + 1} \approx x^2 + \frac{1}{2x^2}\):

\[
\sqrt{x^4 + 1} - x^2 - 1 \approx \left( x^2 + \frac{1}{2x^2} \right) - x^2 - 1 = \frac{1}{2x^2} - 1
\]

As \(x \to \infty\), \(\frac{1}{2x^2} \to 0\), so:

\[
\sqrt{x^4 + 1} - x^2 - 1 \approx -1
\]

Therefore, for large \(x\):

\[
e^{\sqrt{x^4 + 1} - x^2 - 1} \approx e^{-1}
\]

Substituting this back into the expression inside the brackets:

\[
e^{\sqrt{x^4 + 1} - x^2 - 1} - 1 \approx e^{-1} - 1
\]

Since \(e^{-1} - 1\) is a negative constant, the entire expression becomes:

\[
e^{x^2 + 1} \left[ e^{-1} - 1 \right]
\]

As \(x \to \infty\), \(e^{x^2 + 1} \to \infty\). Therefore, the product of \(e^{x^2 + 1}\) and a negative constant \((e^{-1} - 1)\) tends to \(-\infty\):

\[
\lim_{x \to \infty} e^{x^2 + 1} \left[ e^{-1} - 1 \right] = -\infty

 --- Output --- 

[[[To find the area of quadrilateral \(MNCB\) in triangle \(ABC\) where \(C\) is a right angle, we start by identifying the given information and using geometric properties.

1. **Identify Key Lengths and Properties:**
   - \(M\) is the midpoint of \(AB\), so \(AM = BM = \frac{AB}{2}\).
   - \(N\) is the midpoint of \(AC\), so \(AN = NC = \frac{AC}{2}\).
   - \(O\) is the midpoint of \(AM\), so \(AO = OM = \frac{AM}{2} = \frac{AB}{4}\).
   - By the midline theorem in triangle \(AMC\), \(ON\) is parallel to \(MC\) and half its length. Given \(ON = 12.5\) cm, we have \(MC = 25\) cm.
   - Since \(MC\) is the median to the hypotenuse \(AB\), \(MC = \frac{AB}{2}\). Thus, \(AB = 50\) cm.

2. **Solve for Legs \(AC\) and \(BC\):**
   - The perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) is 112 cm, so \(AC + BC + AB = 112\). Given \(AB = 50\), we have \(AC + BC = 62\).
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem: \(AC^2 + BC^2 = 50^2 = 2500\).
   - Solving the system:
     - \((AC + BC)^2 = 62^2 = 3844\)
     - \(AC^2 + BC^2 = 2500\)
     - \(2 \cdot AC \cdot BC = 3844 - 2500 = 1344\)
     - \(AC \cdot BC = 672\)
   - The area of triangle \(ABC\) is \(\frac{1}{2} \cdot AC \cdot BC = 336\) cm².

3. **Calculate the Area of Quadrilateral \(MNCB\):**
   - Using coordinates, the vertices of quadrilateral \(MNCB\) are:
     - \(M\left(\frac{b}{2}, \frac{a}{2}\right)\)
     - \(N(0, \frac{a}{2})\)
     - \(C(0, 0)\)
     - \(B(b, 0)\)
   - Applying the shoelace formula for the area of a quadrilateral with vertices \((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3), (x_4, y_4)\):
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + x_3y_4 + x_4y_1 - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + y_3x_4 + y_4x_1) \right|
     \]
     Substituting the coordinates:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| \left(\frac{b}{2} \cdot \frac{a}{2} + 0 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 0 + b \cdot \frac{a}{2}\right) - \left(\frac{a}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{a}{2} \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot b + 0 \cdot \frac{b}{2}\right) \right|
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| \frac{ab}{4} + \frac{ab}{2} \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| \frac{3ab}{4} \right| = \frac{3ab}{8}

     Substituting \(ab = 672\):
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{3 \cdot 672}{8} = 252

[[[To solve this problem, we need to determine if a course schedule can be completed given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisites. The key insight is to check if there is a cycle in the directed graph formed by the prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it is impossible to complete all courses.

### Approach
The problem can be efficiently solved using Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting. This algorithm helps in detecting cycles in a directed graph by repeatedly removing nodes with zero in-degrees (courses with no prerequisites). If we can process all nodes (courses) this way, the graph has no cycles and the schedule can be completed. Otherwise, a cycle exists.

### Solution Code
```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def can_complete_schedule(num_courses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    if num_courses == 0:
        return True
    
    adj = [[] for _ in range(num_courses)]
    in_degree = [0] * num_courses

    count = 0
    while queue:
        u = queue.popleft()
        count += 1
        for v in adj[u]:
            in_degree[v] -= 1
            if in_degree[v] == 0:
                queue.append(v)
    
    return count == num_courses
```

### Explanation
1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the prerequisites as an adjacency list where each course points to the courses that depend on it. Also, maintain an array to track the in-degree (number of prerequisites) for each course.
2. **Kahn's Algorithm**: 
   - Initialize a queue with all courses having zero in-degree (no prerequisites).
   - Process each course from the queue, decrement the in-degree of its dependent courses.
   - If a dependent course's in-degree becomes zero, add it to the queue.
   - Track the number of processed courses. If this count matches the total number of courses, the schedule is possible (no cycles). Otherwise, a cycle exists.

This approach efficiently checks for cycles using topological sorting with a time complexity of O(N + E), where N is the number of courses and E is the number of prerequisites.<|im_end|><|endoftext|>]]]

 --- Output --- 

[[[To determine the locus of the complex number \( z \) that satisfies the equation \( \left| z + 2 - 6i \right| + \left| z - 2 - 3i \right| = 4 \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Express \( z \) in terms of real and imaginary parts:**
   Let \( z = x + yi \), where \( x \) and \( y \) are real numbers. Substituting \( z \) into the equation, we get:
   \[
   \left| (x + 2) + (y - 6)i \right| + \left| (x - 2) + (y - 3)i \right| = 4

2. **Interpret the equation geometrically:**
   This equation represents the sum of the distances from a point \( (x, y) \) to the points \( (-2, 6) \) and \( (2, 3) \) in the complex plane. For such a sum to form an ellipse, the constant sum must be greater than the distance between the two fixed points.

3. **Calculate the distance between the fixed points:**
   The distance between the points \( (-2, 6) \) and \( (2, 3) \) is:
   \[
   \sqrt{(2 - (-2))^2 + (3 - 6)^2} = \sqrt{4^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 9} = \sqrt{25} = 5
   \]

4. **Compare the given sum with the distance between the points:**
   The given sum of distances is 4, which is less than the distance between the points (5). Therefore, it is impossible for the sum of distances from any point \( (x, y) \) to the points \( (-2, 6) \) and \( (2, 3) \) to be 4.

5. **Conclusion:**
   Since the sum of distances is less than the distance between the fixed points, there are no points \( z \) that satisfy the given equation. Thus, the locus is the empty set.

 --- Output --- 

[[[To solve this problem, we need to write a Python function called `calculate_gcf` that computes the Greatest Common Factor (GCF) of two integers. The function must adhere to specific conditions regarding the input types and values.

### Approach
1. **Check for Integer Input**: The function first verifies if both inputs are integers. If either is not an integer, the function returns -1.
2. **Handle Zero Values**: If either of the input numbers is zero, the function returns 0 immediately, as the GCF involving zero is defined to be zero.
3. **Check for Equal Values**: If the two input numbers are the same and non-zero, the function returns that number as their GCF.
4. **Compute GCF Using Euclidean Algorithm**: For other cases, the function uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCF. This involves repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCF.

### Solution Code
```python

    # Euclidean algorithm
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```

### Explanation
1. **Integer Check**: The function uses `isinstance` to ensure both inputs are integers. If not, it returns -1.
2. **Zero Handling**: If either number is zero, the function returns 0 immediately, as per the problem requirements.
3. **Equal Values**: If both non-zero inputs are the same, the function returns that value directly.
4. **Euclidean Algorithm**: The algorithm efficiently computes the GCF by iteratively reducing the problem size. By taking absolute values of the inputs, the function correctly handles negative numbers, ensuring the GCF is non-negative. The algorithm continues until the remainder is zero, at which point the divisor is the GCF.

This approach ensures that all edge cases and requirements specified in the problem are handled efficiently and correctly.<|im_end|><|endoftext|>]]]

Problem:
In a cryptographic system, a message is encrypted using the formula:

C ≡ M^e (mod n)

where C is the ciphertext, M is the plaintext, e is the public key, and n is the modulus. Given that e = 17, n = 323, and C = 179, find the original plaintext message M, which is an integer from 0 to 322.

Note: You may need to use the properties of modular arithmetic and the concept of multiplicative inverses to solve this problem.<|im_end|>

 --- Output --- 

[[[To find the original plaintext message M, we need to find the value of M that satisfies the equation:

179 ≡ M^17 (mod 323)

Since 17 and 323 are relatively prime (gcd(17, 323) = 1), we can use the property of modular arithmetic that states:

a ≡ b (mod n) ⇒ a^k ≡ b^k (mod n)

for any integer k.

In this case, we can rewrite the equation as:

179 ≡ M^17 (mod 323)
⇒ 179^k ≡ (M^17)^k (mod 323)
⇒ 179^k ≡ M^(17k) (mod 323)

We want to find a value of k such that 17k ≡ 1 (mod 323), which is equivalent to finding the multiplicative inverse of 17 modulo 323.

Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we can find that the multiplicative inverse of 17 modulo 323 is 19, since:

17 × 19 ≡ 1 (mod 323)

Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:

179^19 ≡ M^(17 × 19) (mod 323)
⇒ 179^19 ≡ M^1 (mod 323)
⇒ 179^19 ≡ M (mod 323)

Now, we can compute 179^19 modulo 323 to find the value of M:

179^19 ≡ 97 (mod 323)

Thus, the original plaintext message M is:

M = 97

So, the answer is:

M = \boxed{97}

 --- Output --- 

[[[## Step 1: Understand the conditions given for the five-digit integer
We are given a five-digit integer $A\,B\,C\,D\,E$ with specific properties: it leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 7, and a remainder of 3 when divided by 11. Additionally, $C$ is exactly twice the value of $B$, and the sum of the digits $A + B + D + E = 17$.

## Step 2: Express the conditions using modular arithmetic
From the given conditions, we can express the five-digit integer in terms of modular arithmetic. For the remainder when divided by 7, we have $A\,B\,C\,D\,E \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$. For the remainder when divided by 11, we have $A\,B\,C\,D\,E \equiv 3 \pmod{11}$.

## Step 3: Use the divisibility rule for 11 to express the alternating sum of digits
The divisibility rule for 11 states that a number is divisible by 11 if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 11. Applying this to our number, we have $A - B + C - D + E \equiv 3 \pmod{11}$.

## Step 4: Consider the relationship between B and C
We know that $C$ is exactly twice the value of $B$, so we can express $C$ as $C = 2B$.

## Step 5: Substitute C = 2B into the alternating sum of digits
Substituting $C = 2B$ into the alternating sum, we get $A - B + 2B - D + E \equiv 3 \pmod{11}$, which simplifies to $A + B - D + E \equiv 3 \pmod{11}$.

## Step 6: Use the given sum of digits to relate A, B, D, and E
We are given that $A + B + D + E = 17$. We can use this information to find a relationship between $A, B, D,$ and $E$.

## Step 7: Find the largest possible value of C
To find the largest possible value of $C$, we need to consider the possible values of $B$ and the constraints imposed by the given conditions.

## Step 8: Analyze the constraints on B and C
Since $C$ is twice the value of $B$, the largest possible value of $C$ will depend on the largest possible value of $B$. We need to analyze the constraints on $B$ and $C$ to determine their largest possible values.

## Step 9: Determine the largest possible value of B
Considering the constraints imposed by the given conditions, we can determine the largest possible value of $B$.

## Step 10: Calculate the largest possible value of C
Once we have the largest possible value of $B$, we can calculate the largest possible value of $C$ using the relationship $C = 2B$.

 --- Output --- 

[[[The length of the altitude from vertex $A$ to line $BC$ can be found using the formula:
\[ d = \frac{|Ax + By + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} \]
where $(x, y)$ is a point on the line and $Ax + By + C = 0$ is the equation of the line in standard form.

To find the equation of the line $BC$, we can use the slope-intercept form $y = mx + b$.

First, find the slope $m$ using the coordinates of $B$ and $C$:
\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{0 - (-1)}{4 - (-1)} = \frac{1}{5} \]

Next, find the y-intercept $b$ using the coordinates of $B$ and the slope $m$:
\[ 0 = \frac{1}{5}(4) + b \Rightarrow b = -\frac{4}{5} \]

Now we have the equation of the line in slope-intercept form:
\[ y = \frac{1}{5}x - \frac{4}{5} \]

Convert this to the standard form $Ax + By + C = 0$:
\[ 5y = x - 4 \Rightarrow x - 5y - 4 = 0 \]

Now we can use the formula to find the length of the altitude:
\[ d = \frac{|Ax + By + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} = \frac{|(0) - 5(3) - 4|}{\sqrt{1^2 + (-5)^2}} = \frac{|-19|}{\sqrt{26}} = \frac{19}{\sqrt{26}} \]

Rationalize the denominator:
\[ \frac{19}{\sqrt{26}} = \frac{19}{\sqrt{26}} \times \frac{\sqrt{26}}{\sqrt{26}} = \frac{19\sqrt{26}}{26} \]

Therefore, the length of the altitude is $\boxed{\frac{19\sqrt{26}}{26}}$.<|im_end|><|endoftext|>]]]

Given a cube, how many different rectangular prisms (with edges parallel to the edges of the cube) can be inscribed within it, where at least one vertex of the prism coincides with a vertex of the cube?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
]]]

 --- Output --- 

[[[\boxed{8}
## Step 1: Understand the problem
We need to find the number of different rectangular prisms that can be inscribed within a given cube, where at least one vertex of the prism coincides with a vertex of the cube.

## Step 2: Break down the problem
To solve this problem, we can consider the different ways a rectangular prism can be formed within the cube. Since the edges of the prism are parallel to the edges of the cube, each vertex of the prism must lie on a vertex of the cube.

## Step 3: Count the number of ways to choose vertices
We can start by choosing one vertex of the cube as a vertex of the prism. There are 8 vertices in a cube, so there are 8 ways to choose the first vertex.

## Step 4: Choose the opposite vertex
Once the first vertex is chosen, we need to choose the opposite vertex of the prism. Since the edges of the prism are parallel to the edges of the cube, the opposite vertex must be one of the 7 remaining vertices of the cube that do not share any edges with the first chosen vertex.

## Step 5: Calculate the number of prisms
However, the previous step's reasoning simplifies to just selecting any two opposite vertices of the cube to define the prism's diagonal, which uniquely determines the prism. The correct approach to counting is to consider the pairs of opposite vertices directly.

## Step 6: Count pairs of opposite vertices
In a cube, there are 4 pairs of opposite vertices. Selecting any pair of opposite vertices uniquely determines a prism inscribed within the cube.

## Step 7: Include single-vertex selection
However, the simplification in step 5 overlooks the fact that selecting just one vertex of the cube is enough to define the prism, as that vertex can serve as a corner for multiple prisms. This simplification actually undercounts the possibilities.

## Step 8: Reconsider the counting strategy
Given the misunderstanding in the simplification process, the correct approach is to realize that selecting any vertex of the cube allows for multiple prisms to be formed with that vertex as a corner. This means the initial count of just considering pairs of opposite vertices was too narrow.

## Step 9: Correct counting strategy
For each of the 8 vertices of the cube, there are multiple prisms that can be inscribed with that vertex as one corner. The correct way to enumerate these prisms involves recognizing the different configurations that can be made by selecting the other vertices of the prism from the remaining vertices of the cube.

## Step 10: Enumerate prism configurations
From each selected vertex, there are 7 other vertices to choose from to form the prism. However, considering the configurations where the selected vertices form a diagonal of the prism (which is determined by pairs of opposite vertices) uniquely defines the prism. This realization brings us back to considering pairs of opposite vertices but acknowledges the complexity of counting prisms based on vertex selection.

## Step 11: Finalize counting strategy
Recognizing the oversight in the initial simplification, the focus should be on the unique configurations determined by pairs of opposite vertices. However, this doesn't capture the full range of possibilities as initially thought. Each vertex of the cube can serve as a starting point for multiple prisms, but the correct enumeration involves recognizing the symmetry and shared configurations among these selections.

## Step 12: Apply correct enumeration
Given the symmetry of the cube and the fact that each pair of opposite vertices defines a unique prism, the actual count of unique prisms involves considering these symmetries and the configurations they produce.

## Step 13: Correctly enumerate based on symmetry and configurations
The cube has a high degree of symmetry, which means that many of the prisms are congruent. When considering the unique configurations that can be formed by inscribing prisms within the cube, this symmetry must be taken into account to avoid overcounting.

## Step 14: Finalize the correct enumeration strategy
To correctly count the number of different rectangular prisms, we must consider the unique configurations determined by the cube's symmetry and the fact that each pair of opposite vertices defines a unique prism.

## Step 15: Calculate the final count
Given the cube's symmetry and the method of forming unique prisms based on pairs of opposite vertices, the correct count is derived from considering these unique configurations.

 --- Output --- 

[[[\boxed{b^2 = 4ac}
To find the relationship between the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$, we need to use the properties of the parabola.

The $x$-intercepts of the parabola are the solutions to the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$. Let's denote these solutions as $x_1$ and $x_2$. The sum of the roots is $x_1 + x_2 = -\frac{b}{a}$, and the product of the roots is $x_1x_2 = \frac{c}{a}$.

The vertex of the parabola is the point $(h, k)$, where $h = -\frac{b}{2a}$ and $k = c - \frac{b^2}{4a}$.

Since the vertex is equidistant from the $x$-intercepts, we have:
\[ |h - x_1| = |h - x_2| \Rightarrow h - x_1 = x_2 - h \text{ or } h - x_1 = h - x_2 \]

Substitute $h = -\frac{b}{2a}$:
\[ -\frac{b}{2a} - x_1 = x_2 + \frac{b}{2a} \text{ or } -\frac{b}{2a} - x_1 = -\frac{b}{2a} - x_2 \]

Simplify the equations:
\[ x_1 + x_2 = -\frac{b}{a} \text{ or } x_1 = x_2 \]

Since $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of the quadratic equation, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = -\frac{b}{a}$.

However, the condition $x_1 = x_2$ implies that the parabola has a double root, which means that the discriminant $b^2 - 4ac = 0$.

Therefore, the relationship between the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$ is:
\[ b^2 - 4ac = 0 \Rightarrow b^2 = 4ac \]

So, the answer is:

[[[This problem is about finding the smallest positive integer n that has at least 8 good divisors. A good divisor d of n is a divisor of at least one proper divisor of n not equal to d.

To start, consider what types of numbers have many divisors. Prime numbers have only two divisors, 1 and the number itself, so they are not good candidates for having many good divisors. On the other hand, numbers that are the product of many smaller prime numbers tend to have more divisors.

Consider the number $2^3 \cdot 3 = 24$. Its divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Of these, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 are good divisors, because each of these divides another proper divisor of 24. For example, 2 divides 4, 3 divides 6, and so on.

Since we need at least 8 good divisors, let's consider the next number that might work. If we multiply 24 by another prime number, we might get a number with at least 8 good divisors.

Consider the number $2^3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = 120$. Its divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120. Of these, at least 8 are good divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10), because each of these divides another proper divisor of 120.

We want to find the number of values of $x$ such that:
\[ [x^2] + \{2x\} = 11 \Rightarrow k + f = 11 \]

Since $k$ is an integer and $0 \leq f < 1$, we have:
\[ k = 11 \quad \text{and} \quad f = 0 \]

Now, let's find the possible values of $x$:

From $[x^2] = k = 11$, we have:
\[ 11 \leq x^2 < 12 \Rightarrow \sqrt{11} \leq |x| < \sqrt{12} \]

Since $\{2x\} = f = 0$, we have:
\[ 2x = \text{integer} \Rightarrow x = \frac{\text{integer}}{2} \]

Combining the two conditions, we get:
\[ x = \pm \frac{\sqrt{11}}{2}, \pm \frac{\sqrt{12}}{2}, \pm \frac{\sqrt{11} + 1}{2}, \pm \frac{\sqrt{12} - 1}{2} \]

However, not all of these values satisfy the original equation. We need to check which values of $x$ satisfy:

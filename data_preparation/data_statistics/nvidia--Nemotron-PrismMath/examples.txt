15. [9] A cat is going up a stairwell with ten stairs.

How many different ways can the cat go from the bottom to the top?<|im_end|>

 --- Output --- 

[[[To solve the problem of finding the number of ways the cat can go up a 10-stair stairwell by jumping 2 or 3 stairs at each step (and taking a single step if necessary at the end), we can use a dynamic programming approach. 

We define \( f(n) \) as the number of ways to reach step \( n \) using jumps of 2 or 3 stairs. The recurrence relation is:
\[ f(n) = f(n-2) + f(n-3) \]
with base cases:
\[ f(0) = 1, \quad f(1) = 0, \quad f(2) = 1, \quad f(3) = 1 \]

We compute \( f(n) \) for \( n \) from 0 to 10:

\[
\begin{array}{c|c}
n & f(n) \\
\hline
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0 \\
2 & 1 \\
3 & 1 \\
4 & f(2) + f(1) = 1 + 0 = 1 \\
5 & f(3) + f(2) = 1 + 1 = 2 \\
6 & f(4) + f(3) = 1 + 1 = 2 \\
7 & f(5) + f(4) = 2 + 1 = 3 \\
8 & f(6) + f(5) = 2 + 2 = 4 \\
9 & f(7) + f(6) = 3 + 2 = 5 \\
10 & f(8) + f(7) = 4 + 3 = 7 \\
\end{array}
\]

The total number of ways to reach the top (step 10) is the sum of the ways to reach step 10 using only 2s and 3s, plus the ways to reach step 9 using only 2s and 3s (then taking a single step from 9 to 10):
\[ \text{total\_ways} = f(10) + f(9) = 7 + 5 = 12 \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[

 --- Output --- 

[[[Given a trapezoid \(ABCD\) with \(AB \parallel CD\), where \(AB = 2\), \(CD = 4\), and \(AD = BC = \sqrt{13}\). We need to find the length of diagonal \(BD\).

First, we note that since \(AB \parallel CD\) and \(AD = BC\), the trapezoid is isosceles. In an isosceles trapezoid, the diagonals are equal in length.

We place the trapezoid on a coordinate system:
- \(A(0, 0)\)
- \(B(2, 0)\)
- \(D(x, h)\)
- \(C(x + 4, h)\)

Using the distance formula for \(AD\) and \(BC\):
- For \(AD\): \(\sqrt{x^2 + h^2} = \sqrt{13}\)
- For \(BC\): \(\sqrt{(x + 2)^2 + h^2} = \sqrt{13}\)

Solving these equations:
1. \(x^2 + h^2 = 13\)
2. \((x + 2)^2 + h^2 = 13\)

Subtracting the first equation from the second:
\[ (x + 2)^2 - x^2 = 0 \]
\[ x^2 + 4x + 4 - x^2 = 0 \]
\[ 4x + 4 = 0 \]
\[ x = -1 \]

Substituting \(x = -1\) back into the first equation:
\[ (-1)^2 + h^2 = 13 \]
\[ 1 + h^2 = 13 \]
\[ h^2 = 12 \]
\[ h = 2\sqrt{3} \]

Thus, the coordinates are:
- \(A(0, 0)\)
- \(B(2, 0)\)
- \(D(-1, 2\sqrt{3})\)
- \(C(3, 2\sqrt{3})\)

Calculating the distance \(BD\):
\[ BD = \sqrt{(2 - (-1))^2 + (0 - 2\sqrt{3})^2} \]
\[ BD = \sqrt{(3)^2 + (2\sqrt{3})^2} \]
\[ BD = \sqrt{9 + 12} \]
\[ BD = \sqrt{21} \]

Thus, the length of \(BD\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{21}}\).<|im_end|><|endoftext|>]]]

 --- Output --- 

[[[Given the problem, we need to find digits \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(a \neq 0\)) such that the expression \(9(\overline{a b 5} - \overline{a b})(\overline{a b} + 1) + 4\) is a perfect square.

First, we express \(\overline{a b}\) as \(10a + b\) and \(\overline{a b 5}\) as \(100a + 10b + 5\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
9[(100a + 10b + 5) - (10a + b)][(10a + b) + 1] + 4
\]

Simplifying the terms inside the brackets:

1. \(\overline{a b 5} - \overline{a b} = (100a + 10b + 5) - (10a + b) = 90a + 9b + 5\)
2. \(\overline{a b} + 1 = (10a + b) + 1 = 10a + b + 1\)

Substituting these back into the expression:

\[
9(90a + 9b + 5)(10a + b + 1) + 4
\]

Let \(X = 10a + b\). Then, the expression becomes:

\[
9(9X + 5)(X + 1) + 4
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
9(9X + 5)(X + 1) + 4 = 9(9X^2 + 14X + 5) + 4 = 81X^2 + 126X + 45 + 4 = 81X^2 + 126X + 49
\]

Recognizing this as a perfect square:

\[
81X^2 + 126X + 49 = (9X + 7)^2
\]

Since \(X = 10a + b\) is a two-digit number (ranging from 10 to 99), the expression \((9X + 7)^2\) is always a perfect square for any valid \(X\). Therefore, the expression is a perfect square for any digits \(a\) (1-9) and \(b\) (0-9).

[[[To determine all integer solutions to the equation \( x^4 - 6x^3 + 11x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0 \), we start by checking if the equation can be factored. 

First, we consider if the equation can be expressed as a perfect square of a quadratic. We find that it factors as \( (x^2 - 3x + 1)^2 = 0 \). Solving the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x + 1 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula, we get the roots \( x = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2} \). These roots are not integers.

Next, we use the rational root theorem to check for possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are ±1, but testing these values shows they are not roots of the equation. 

We also attempt to factor the quartic equation into two quadratics with integer coefficients, but this only confirms the earlier factorization as a perfect square. 

Testing small integer values for \( x \) (both positive and negative) shows none of them satisfy the equation.

To solve this, we consider arranging the sequence as an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 3. This sequence is \( 0, 3, 6, 9, \ldots, 3n \). 

When we compute the sums \( a_i + a_j \) for \( 0 \leq i \leq j \leq n \), the resulting sums are multiples of 3, ranging from 0 to \( 6n \). Each integer multiple of 3 in this range is achievable, leading to the set of sums being \( \{0, 3, 6, 9, \ldots, 6n\} \).

The number of distinct sums is the number of distinct multiples of 3 from 0 to \( 6n \), which is \( 2n + 1 \). This is because the sequence of sums forms an arithmetic progression with 0 as the first term, 3 as the common difference, and \( 6n \) as the last term, resulting in \( 2n + 1 \) distinct terms.

First, we use the properties of logarithms to combine the first equation:

\[
\log_{2}{x} + \log_{2}{y} = \log_{2}{(xy)} = 6
\]

This implies:

\[
xy = 2^6 = 64

Next, we use the second equation:

2. \(xy = 64\)

To find \(x^2 + y^2\), we use the algebraic identity:

\[
(x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2

Substituting the known values:

\[

The characteristic equation is obtained by assuming a solution of the form \(r^n\). Substituting this into the recurrence relation gives:
\[ r^2 = 4r - 3 \]
which simplifies to:
\[ r^2 - 4r + 3 = 0 \]

Factoring this quadratic equation, we get:

Thus, the roots are \(r = 1\) and \(r = 3\). The general solution to the recurrence relation is:

\[ d_n = A + B \cdot 3^n \]

Using the initial conditions to solve for \(A\) and \(B\):
1. For \(n = 1\): \(d_1 = A + 3B = 1\)
2. For \(n = 2\): \(d_2 = A + 9B = 3\)

Subtracting the first equation from the second:

\[ 6B = 2 \]
\[ B = \frac{1}{3} \]

Substituting \(B = \frac{1}{3}\) back into the first equation:

\[ A + 1 = 1 \]
\[ A = 0 \]

Thus, the general solution is:

To find \(d_7\):
\[ d_7 = 3^{7-1} = 3^6 = 729 \]

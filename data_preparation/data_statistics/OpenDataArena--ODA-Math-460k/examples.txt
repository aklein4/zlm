 --- Output --- 

[[[To determine the equation representing the height of the dog after \( L \) laps, we start by analyzing the given sequence of heights. The sequence is provided as \( 20 + 4, 20 + 8, \ldots \). 

First, we observe the pattern in the sequence. The first term (after 1 lap) is \( 20 + 4 \), the second term (after 2 laps) is \( 20 + 8 \), and so on. The added values (4, 8, ...) form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 4. 

For \( L \) laps, the added value is \( 4 \times L \). Thus, the height after \( L \) laps is the initial value (20) plus the added value for \( L \) laps. 

This results in the equation:
\[ h = 20 + 4L \]

\[
\boxed{h = 20 + 4L}
\]
Final answer: \boxed{20 + 4L}<|im_end|><|endoftext|>]]]

Honzík received a book for Christmas and started reading it on Christmas Eve. He read the same number of pages daily until January 31st of the new year. On that day, he found out that he had read 78 pages, which was exactly one third of the book. Additionally, he realized that if he wanted to finish the book by his birthday, starting from the next day, he would need to read four more pages each day than he had been reading.

 --- Output --- 

[[[Honzík started reading on Christmas Eve (December 24th) and read daily until January 31st. We first calculate the number of days he read during this period:

- From December 24th to December 31st: \(31 - 24 + 1 = 8\) days.
- From January 1st to January 31st: 31 days.
- Total days: \(8 + 31 = 39\) days.

He read 78 pages in these 39 days, which is one-third of the book. Let \(x\) be the number of pages read daily. Then:
\[ 39x = 78 \implies x = 2 \text{ pages/day}. \]

The total number of pages in the book is \(78 \times 3 = 234\) pages. The remaining pages to read after January 31st are \(234 - 78 = 156\) pages.

To finish the book by his birthday, he needs to read \(x + 4 = 2 + 4 = 6\) pages per day starting from February 1st. Let \(d\) be the number of days required to read the remaining 156 pages at this new rate:
\[ 6d = 156 \implies d = 26 \text{ days}. \]

Starting from February 1st, 26 days later is February 26th. Thus, Honzík's birthday is February 26th.

\[
\boxed{February\ 26}
\]
Final answer: \boxed{February 26}<|im_end|><|endoftext|>]]]

 --- Output --- 

[[[To find the value of \(\cos 85^\circ\), we start by recognizing that \(85^\circ\) is complementary to \(5^\circ\) (since \(90^\circ - 85^\circ = 5^\circ\)). Using the co-function identity, \(\cos \theta = \sin(90^\circ - \theta)\), we have:

\[
\cos 85^\circ = \sin(90^\circ - 85^\circ) = \sin 5^\circ
\]

Next, we calculate \(\sin 5^\circ\) numerically. Converting \(5^\circ\) to radians (though not necessary for direct calculation), we use the known approximate value of \(\sin 5^\circ\). Using a calculator or trigonometric tables, we find:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \approx 0.08715574275
\]

Thus, \(\cos 85^\circ \approx 0.08715574275\). Rounding to a reasonable number of decimal places (e.g., five), we get approximately \(0.08716\).

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{k+2}{k} \right)^{(-1)^{k+1}k}

We separate the product into even and odd terms and analyze the partial products. By examining the behavior of the partial products and using Stirling's approximation for factorials, we find that the even partial products converge to a specific limit. 

Through detailed analysis, we determine that the even partial products converge to \(\frac{\pi}{2e}\).

 --- Output --- 

[[[To construct the left Riemann sum \( L_n \) for a function \( f \) on \([a, b]\):

1. **Partition the interval**: Divide \([a, b]\) into \( n \) subintervals of equal width. The width of each subinterval is \( \Delta x = \frac{b - a}{n} \).

2. **Identify endpoints**: Define the endpoints of the subintervals as \( x_i = a + i\Delta x \) for \( i = 0, 1, \ldots, n \). Here, \( x_0 = a \) and \( x_n = b \).

3. **Choose left endpoints**: For each subinterval \([x_i, x_{i+1}]\), the left endpoint is \( x_i \) (where \( i = 0, 1, \ldots, n-1 \)).

4. **Sum the areas of rectangles**: For each subinterval, approximate the area under \( f \) using a rectangle with height \( f(x_i) \) (the function value at the left endpoint) and width \( \Delta x \). The total approximation is the sum of these rectangle areas.

Thus, the left Riemann sum \( L_n \) is given by summing \( f(x_i) \Delta x \) for \( i \) from \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \).

[[[To find the value of \(\cos\left(\frac{5\pi}{6} + \alpha\right)\) given that \(\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{6} - \alpha\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\), we start by examining the relationship between the angles \(\frac{\pi}{6} - \alpha\) and \(\frac{5\pi}{6} + \alpha\).

First, we note that the sum of these two angles is:
\[
\left(\frac{\pi}{6} - \alpha\right) + \left(\frac{5\pi}{6} + \alpha\right) = \frac{\pi}{6} + \frac{5\pi}{6} - \alpha + \alpha = \pi
\]
This means the angles are supplementary (their sum is \(\pi\)). 

Recall the trigonometric identity for the cosine of a supplementary angle:
\[
\cos(\pi - \theta) = -\cos\theta
\]

Let \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{6} - \alpha\). Then, \(\frac{5\pi}{6} + \alpha = \pi - \theta\). Using the identity above:
\[
\cos\left(\frac{5\pi}{6} + \alpha\right) = \cos(\pi - \theta) = -\cos\theta
\]

Substituting \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{6} - \alpha\) and using the given value \(\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{6} - \alpha\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\):
\[
\cos\left(\frac{5\pi}{6} + \alpha\right) = -\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{6} - \alpha\right) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}

Thus, the value of \(\cos\left(\frac{5\pi}{6} + \alpha\right)\) is \(\boxed{-\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{3}}\).<|im_end|><|endoftext|>]]]

\[
\arctan(x) = x - \frac{x^3}{3} + \frac{x^5}{5} - \frac{x^7}{7} + \ldots
\]

First, substitute \( x \) with \( \frac{x^2}{5} \) in the series expansion:

\[
\arctan\left(\frac{x^2}{5}\right) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1} \left( \frac{x^2}{5} \right)^{2n+1}
\]

Expanding the general term of the series:

\[
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1} \cdot \frac{x^{4n+2}}{5^{2n+1}}
\]

We need the coefficient of \( x^6 \) in this series because the sixth derivative at \( 0 \) is related to the coefficient of \( x^6 \) in the Taylor series expansion. 

For the term with \( x^6 \), we set \( 4n + 2 = 6 \), which gives \( n = 1 \). Substituting \( n = 1 \):

\[
\text{Term for } n=1: \frac{(-1)^1}{2(1)+1} \cdot \frac{x^{4(1)+2}}{5^{2(1)+1}} = \frac{-1}{3} \cdot \frac{x^6}{125} = -\frac{x^6}{375}
\]

The coefficient of \( x^6 \) is \( -\frac{1}{375} \). 

In the Taylor series expansion \( f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!} x^k \), the coefficient of \( x^6 \) is \( \frac{f^{(6)}(0)}{6!} \). Thus:

\[
\frac{f^{(6)}(0)}{6!} = -\frac{1}{375}
\]

Solving for \( f^{(6)}(0) \):

\[
f^{(6)}(0) = -\frac{1}{375} \cdot 6!
\]

Since \( 6! = 720 \):

\[
f^{(6)}(0) = -\frac{720}{375} = -\frac{48}{25}

The final answer is \(\boxed{-\dfrac{48}{25}}\).<|im_end|><|endoftext|>]]]

To determine if the system of equations has a finite or infinite number of integer solutions, we start by analyzing the given equations:

1. \( w + x + y + z = 0 \)
2. \( 3w + 2x + y = 3 \)

First, solve the second equation for \( y \):
\[ y = 3 - 3w - 2x \]

Next, substitute this expression for \( y \) into the first equation:
\[ w + x + (3 - 3w - 2x) + z = 0 \]

Simplify the left-hand side:
\[ w + x + 3 - 3w - 2x + z = 0 \]
\[ -2w - x + 3 + z = 0 \]

Solve for \( z \):
\[ z = 2w + x - 3 \]

Now, \( y \) and \( z \) are expressed in terms of \( w \) and \( x \). Since \( w \) and \( x \) are integers, \( y \) and \( z \) will also be integers (as integer combinations of integers are integers). 

The variables \( w \) and \( x \) can take any integer values, and each pair \((w, x)\) uniquely determines \( y \) and \( z \). Since there are infinitely many integer pairs \((w, x)\), there are infinitely many solutions to the system.

- Multiply the minutes: \(31' \times 4 = 124'\)
- Convert excess minutes to degrees: \(124' = 2^{\circ}4'\) (since \(124' = 2 \times 60' + 4'\))
- Add the converted degrees to the total degrees: \(96^{\circ} + 2^{\circ}4' = 98^{\circ}4'\)

### Step 2: Subtract \(62^{\circ}10'\) from \(98^{\circ}4'\)
- Convert \(98^{\circ}4'\) to a form with enough minutes to subtract \(10'\):  
  Borrow \(1^{\circ}\) (which is \(60'\)) from \(98^{\circ}\), resulting in \(97^{\circ}64'\)
- Subtract the degrees: \(97^{\circ} - 62^{\circ} = 35^{\circ}\)
- Subtract the minutes: \(64' - 10' = 54'\)

In a rectangular coordinate system, what is the number of units in the distance from the origin to the point $(-15, 8)$?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
]]]

 --- Output --- 

[[[\boxed{17}
To find the distance between the origin $(0, 0)$ and the point $(-15, 8)$ in a rectangular coordinate system, we can use the distance formula:
$$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$
where $(x_1, y_1)$ is the coordinate of the first point and $(x_2, y_2)$ is the coordinate of the second point.
Substituting the values for the origin and the given point, we get:
<llm-code>
from sympy import sqrt

x1, y1, x2, y2 = 0, 0, -15, 8

distance = sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)
distance
</llm-code>
<llm-code-output>
17
</llm-code-output>
So the distance between the origin and the point $(-15, 8)$ is $\boxed{17}$ units.<|im_end|><|endoftext|>]]]

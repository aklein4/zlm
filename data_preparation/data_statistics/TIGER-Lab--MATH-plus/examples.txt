The shaded area is equal to the area of sector $PQS$ minus the area of triangle $PQS.$

Since $\angle PQS = 60^\circ$ and $PQ = 10,$ the area of sector $PQS$ is
\[\frac{1}{6} \cdot 10^2 \cdot \pi = \frac{50}{3} \pi.\]Also, triangle $PQS$ is equilateral with side length 10, so its area is
\[\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \cdot 10^2 = 25 \sqrt{3}.\]Thus, the area of the right part of the shaded region is $\frac{50}{3}\pi - 25\sqrt{3},$ so the area of the entire shaded region is $$2\left(\frac{50}{3}\pi-25\sqrt{3}\right)=\boxed{\frac{100}{3}\pi-50\sqrt{3}}.$$ The answer is \frac{100}{3}\pi-50\sqrt{3}.

Let $x=AC=BF$, $y=AD=BE$, and $z=AE=BD$.
Ptolemy's Theorem on $ABCD$ gives $100y+20\cdot 100=xz$, and Ptolemy on $ACDF$ gives $x\cdot z+100^2=y^2$. Subtracting these equations give $y^2-100y-120\cdot 100=0$, and from this $y=180$. Ptolemy on $ADEF$ gives $100y+100^2=z^2$, and from this $z=140$. Finally, plugging back into the first equation gives $x=120$, so $x+y+z=120+180+140=\boxed{440}$.
